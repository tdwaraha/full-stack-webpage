<h2>About</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Dwaraha Thushaanth, and I am a recent computer programming graduate with honors standing. I am excited to share my journey with you as I transition from being a registered pharmacy technician to pursuing my passion in the field of information technology. With a strong impression of the vast opportunities and potential that the IT industry offers, I am eager to explore the different aspects of computer programming and share my experiences with you. Join me as I embark on this new chapter of my life, filled with learning, growth, and exciting opportunities</p>
<p> I am always prepared to learn new things and gain new experiences. I enjoy meeting people and working with them in a team environment where I get to develop my skills and improve myself. I try my best to help people and usually try to keep communications open to achieve mutual understanding. I am open to strong opinions and encourage constructive criticisms.</p>
<p>My hobbies include reading personal development books, learning something new from the internet, music and playing instruments like guitar and the keyboard. </p>
